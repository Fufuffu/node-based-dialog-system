üí° **About: Nodes-based dialog system** asset is a tool that 
allows game developers to create branching dialog trees for their game 
characters easily. It is a visual editor that allows users to create and
connect nodes to build conversations between characters in their game. 
Each node represents a piece of dialog, and the connections between 
nodes determine the flow of the conversation.

A **Node Editor** presents an editable graph, displaying 
nodes and the connections between their attributes. You can create 
simple sentence node or node with answers to build your own dialog.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Node Editor

# STEP 1: How to open node editor window

1. Right-click to the **assets folder**.
2. Go to ***Create/ScribtableObjects/Nodes/NodeGraph**.*
3. Double click on your new **DialogNodeGraph** assets and you are done!
4. You can also go to **Window/DialogNodeBasedEditor**, but you still have to create **NodeGraph** SO and click on it.

# STEP 2: Orientation

1. By holding the **left mouse button** you can **move** around the window.
2. **Right mouse** button opens **context menu**. It has options such as ‚ÄúCreate sentence node‚Äù, ‚Äú**Create answer node**‚Äù, ‚Äú**Select all nodes**‚Äù and ‚Äú**Remove selected nodes**‚Äù.
3. To **connect** nodes together, hold down the right mouse button on the node and drag it to.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sentence Node

1. **Sentence node** can only join **one** any other node (Has one parent and one child node).
2. The node has the following **parameters**: 1. **Name** 2. **Sentence** 3. **Sprite** (You can leave it **null**).
3. By clicking the ‚Äú**Add external function**‚Äù button, another field appears for the name of the function that you previously added ([More on this below](https://www.notion.so/Dialog-Node-Based-System-Unity-asset-tool-5e73a66631b54705a3dc7c82eb841e96?pvs=21)).
4. Click the ‚Äú**Remove external function**‚Äù button to **remove** external function üôÇ.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Answer Node

1. **Answer node** has an **infinite** parent node, but child nodes depend on **the number of answers** in the node (Answer node can‚Äôt join to answer node).
2. By clicking the "**Add Answer**" button, you will add another answer option (The number of answer options is unlimited).
3. You can delete the **last answer** option by clicking the corresponding button.

# üîß How to Use and Technical Part

1. To use dialog system you can just drag and drop **Dialog Prefab** from the **Prefab folder** and call **StartsDialog** method from **DialogBehaviour** script that **attached** to this prefab.

üí° It is recommended that another script call this method instead of doing it in the DialogBehaviour script. For example, as in the demo script.

```csharp
// Test script to call StartDialog method
public class TestDialogStarter : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private DialogBehaviour dialogBehaviour;
    [SerializeField] private DialogNodeGraph dialogGraph;

    private void Start()
    {
        dialogBehaviour.StartDialog(dialogGraph);
    }
}
```

**StartDialog** method from the **DialogBehaviour** script. As you can see, you need to pass **DialogNodeGraph** as a parameter.

```csharp
 public void StartDialog(DialogNodeGraph dialogNodeGraph)
 {
     isDialogStarted = true;

     if (dialogNodeGraph.nodesList == null)
     {
         Debug.LogWarning("Dialog Graph's node list is empty");
         return;
     }

     onDialogStarted?.Invoke();

     currentNodeGraph = dialogNodeGraph;

     DefineFirstNode(dialogNodeGraph);
     CalculateMaxAmountOfAnswerButtons();
     HandleDialogGraphCurrentNode(currentNode);
 }
```

1. You can bind **external functions** to use them in **sentence node**. There is a method for this called **BindExternalFunction**. It takes as parameters the name of the function and the function itself. This method can then be used in a sentence node, it will be called along with this node.

üí° You need to bind an external function before calling it.

```csharp
public void BindExternalFunction(string funcName, Action function);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public class TestDialogStarter : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private DialogBehaviour dialogBehaviour;
    [SerializeField] private DialogNodeGraph dialogGraph;

    private void Start()
    {
        dialogBehaviour.BindExternalFunction("Test", DebugExternal);

        dialogBehaviour.StartDialog(dialogGraph);
    }

    private void DebugExternal()
    {
        Debug.Log("External function works!");
    }
}
```

1. In the inspector you can configure **parameters** such as:
- **Dialog Char Dalay** (float) - delay before printing characters or text printing speed
- **Next Sentence Key Codes** (List<enum>) - keys when pressed that load the next sentence
- Is Can Skipping Text (bool) - If true - when you press the keys, instantly print the current sentence
- OnDialogStarted and OnDialogEnded events.

üí° You can assign all these parameters in code
